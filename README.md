# Web Server in C++

This project implements a **HTTP/1.1 web server from scratch** using only **C++** and a **Makefile**.

It supports:

- Parsing HTTP requests (GET, POST, DELETE)  
- Routing requests to servers and locations defined in a configuration file  
- Returning proper HTTP responses, including **CGI support**  
- Handling errors with corresponding HTTP error responses  

---

## ðŸ›  Installation

Use the included **Makefile**:

```bash
make        # Build all object files and executable
make run    # Build executable and clean object files
make clean  # Remove object files
make fclean # Remove object files and executable
make re     # Clean + build fresh executable
```

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

Run the server with a path to your configuration file:

```bash
./webserv <path_to_configuration_file>

```
